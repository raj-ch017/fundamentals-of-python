    "### What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is designed to be easy to read, write, and maintain. It has a simple and expressive syntax that makes it accessible to beginners, while its vast library of modules and tools make it a popular choice for professional developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is used in a wide variety of applications, from web development and scientific computing to artificial intelligence and machine learning. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, simplicity, and ease of use, which makes it a great choice for projects of any size or complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Having accurate syntax is extremely significant when coding. Even the slightest mistake, such as a missing parentheses or an extra comma, can result in a syntax error, which would prevent the code from running entirely. It's vital to be attentive to the syntax if the code produces an error or an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the syntax is precise, and the script still displays unexpected behavior or results, the problem could be semantic. It's important to remember that syntax denotes the rules for constructing code, while semantics relates to the meaning of coded statements. **What is the code intended to accomplish?** Although it's possible to have syntactically correct code that runs successfully, it may not perform the desired task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "The semantics of a language associates a meaning with each syntactically correct string of symbols that has no static semantic errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Python, the statement means that for every syntactically correct sequence of code, there is a well-defined meaning associated with it, known as its `semantic`. This meaning determines the code's behaviour at runtime and is crucial to programming languages like Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example**, the semantics of a function call in Python determines the input arguments it expects, the output it returns, and the side effects it may have."

The `print()` function is used again to output the sum to the console, along with some additional text.\n",

    "In the previous example, the `print()` function was used to display a message on the screen. However, functions can do much more than that.
