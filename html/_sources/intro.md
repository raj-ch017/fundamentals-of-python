Fundamentals of Python
</h2>

My experience with Python began with a crash course provided by Google on Coursera. You can find the link for the course here: [Crash Course on Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course)

Through the completion of the course, I gained knowledge of the language's fundamental constructs, including loops, branching, and operators. Additionally, the course provided insight into complex data structures like lists, dictionaries, and Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) capabilities. 

Utilizing the foundational knowledge and skills acquired during my Python course, I have developed this exciting project that showcases my abilities in programming, debugging, and writing docstrings. The project represents a significant step forward in my development as a computational problem solver. 

One of the main takeaways from this project has been the importance of building strong problem-solving skills, which are essential for success in any field that requires technical expertise. I found it incredibly satisfying to take a complex problem and break it down into manageable steps, arriving at a solution through perseverance and attention to detail. This project has motivated me to continue my learning journey, and I am eager to tackle even more challenging and rewarding projects in the future.
